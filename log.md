# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Reviewed Git and GitHub Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9fIBT2NBGY
2. Setup my Git repository

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
